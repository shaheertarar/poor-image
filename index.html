        <div class="main">
            <p>The <span class="funky">poor</span> image is a copy in motion.<br> Its quality is bad, its resolution substandard. As it accelerates, it <span class="blur-text">deteriorates</span>. It is a ghost of an image, a preview, a thumbnail, an errant idea, an itinerant image distributed for free, squeezed through slow digital connections, compressed, reproduced, ripped, remixed, as well as copied and pasted into other channels of distribution.</p>
            <img src="pixel.webp">
            <p>The poor <a href="cat.html">image</a> is a rag or a rip; an AVI or a JPEG, a lumpen proletarian in the class society of appearances, ranked and valued according to its resolution.<span class="big-text"> The poor image has been uploaded, downloaded, shared, reformatted, and reedited</span>. It transforms quality into accessibility, exhibition value into cult value, films into clips, contemplation into distraction. The image is liberated from the vaults of cinemas and archives and thrust into digital uncertainty, at the expense of its own substance. The poor image tends towards abstraction: it is a visual idea in its very becoming.</p>
